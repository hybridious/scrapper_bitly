# ScrapperShort
URL Link Shortener scrapper,

A lot of people use Link-Shorteners (Bit.ly, tinyurl, goo.gl, etc...) to shorten our links so it's easy to share them only online or even between mobile devices. But sometimes, people use this kind of services without wondering if someone else can access to that URL and access to that URL that you want to share. On particular, some people use this services to share internal links, dropbox folder links, google docs links or personal stuff. This project aims to find those '''treasures'''
